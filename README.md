## Problem solving

One of the fundamental problems of space missions is a time synchronization between Earth
and Space. The time on Mars and Earth is ticking differently and it is necessary to keep it under
control. Here are some useful links: one, two, three.
You need to write a microservice that we will install on our spaceships, satellites and in
the Billie Mars office in 212 .
That microservice should receive the time on Earth in UTC as an input and return two values:
the Mars Sol Date (MSD) and the Martian Coordinated Time (MTC).
